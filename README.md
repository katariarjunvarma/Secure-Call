# Secure-Call

Secure-Call is a Python-based project designed to provide a secure interface for system calls. It includes features for authentication, logging, and form handling, and is built with modularity and extensibility in mind.

instance/             # Instance-specific files (e.g., database)
__pycache__/          # Compiled Python files

```

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication is implemented in [`auth.py`](auth.py).
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging utilities are available in [`logger.py`](logger.py).
- **Form Handling**: Forms are managed and validated in [`forms.py`](forms.py).
- **Secure System Calls**: System calls are securely handled in [`system_calls.py`](system_calls.py).
- **HTML Templates**: Predefined templates for the user interface are located in the `templates/` directory.
- **Static Assets**: CSS and JavaScript files are stored in the `static/` directory.
